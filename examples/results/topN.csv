Although marketing researchers have studied the impacts of CSR activities on stakeholder responses, the CSR activities and outcomes measured have been varied and inconsistent. In this article we (a) review the extant literature to outline which CSR activities and outcomes have been included in previous research; (b) synthesize the means by which CSR activities can add value for consumers and how these have been represented in CSR literature, and; (c) present a research agenda for future research to allow greater consistency among CSR researchers.

A systematic review Corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities have the potential to create stronger relationships between firms and stakeholders. Although marketing researchers have studied the impacts of CSR activities on stakeholder responses, the CSR activities and outcomes measured have been varied and inconsistent. In this article we (a) review the extant literature to outline which CSR activities and outcomes have been included in previous research; (b) synthesize the means by which CSR activities can add value for consumers and how these have been represented in CSR literature, and; (c) present a research agenda for future research to allow greater consistency among CSR researchers.

A survey of consumers has been made to meet the objective of the research. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is conducted to identify different dimensions of CSR perception of consumers and subsequently the impact of these dimensions of CSR on purchase behaviour is tested using multiple regression analysis. CSR perception of consumer has been factorised into four dimensions: Instrumental CSR (ICSR), normative CSR (NCSR), non-voluntary (NVCSR) and legal CSR (LCSR).

A survey of consumers has been made to meet the objective of the research. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is conducted to identify different dimensions of CSR perception of consumers and subsequently the impact of these dimensions of CSR on purchase behaviour is tested using multiple regression analysis. CSR perception of consumer has been factorised into four dimensions: Instrumental CSR (ICSR), normative CSR (NCSR), non-voluntary (NVCSR) and legal CSR (LCSR). ICSR and NCSR are found to positively impact purchase intention and willingness to pay; whereas LCSR negatively impacts purchase behaviour and NVCSR has no influence on consumers.

Moreover, previous studies have examined CSR in cross-sectional, experimental, and/or artificial settings. Through field survey data collected at both the beginning (n = 750) and conclusion (n = 469) of the 2007-2008 NBA season, the authors investigate linkages between customers' perceptions of the CSR performance of an NBA team and the strength of their relationship with this same organization. With all respondents of the latter survey participating in both samples, the authors assess how CSR performance impacts customer relationships over time. The findings show how a firm that engages in CSR initiatives may reap rewards by building trusting and committed customer relationships which, in turn, help forge desirable customer behaviors. The results also demonstrate how CSR's influence strengthens over the course of the tested business cycle, thus yielding revealing insights to academics and practitioners when it comes to understanding the real-world impact of CSR performance for strengthening customer relationships.

Moreover, previous studies have examined CSR in cross-sectional, experimental, and/or artificial settings. Through field survey data collected at both the beginning (n = 750) and conclusion (n = 469) of the 2007-2008 NBA season, the authors investigate linkages between customers' perceptions of the CSR performance of an NBA team and the strength of their relationship with this same organization. With all respondents of the latter survey participating in both samples, the authors assess how CSR performance impacts customer relationships over time. The findings show how a firm that engages in CSR initiatives may reap rewards by building trusting and committed customer relationships which, in turn, help forge desirable customer behaviors. The results also demonstrate how CSR's influence strengthens over the course of the tested business cycle, thus yielding revealing insights to academics and practitioners when it comes to understanding the real-world impact of CSR performance for strengthening customer relationships.

The authors also examine how CSR credibility strengthens the customers' CSR perceptionâCâC identification relationship and the indirect relationship between CSR perception and CSR participation intention through CâC identification. We conducted a survey of 567 South Korean bank customers and performed structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. CâC identification partially mediated the relationship between customers' CSR perception and CSR participation intention. The positive association between customers' CSR perception and CâC identification was more pronounced when CSR credibility was higher than when it was lower. CSR credibility further moderated the indirect effect of customers' CSR perception and CSR participation intention through C-C identification. This study deepens CSR research by showing how a cognitive CSR perception leads to a behavioral CSR participation based on a research model.

The role of CSR credibility and customerâcompany identification This study aims to investigate the effects of customers' perception of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on their CSR participation intention via customerâcompany identification (CâC identification). The authors also examine how CSR credibility strengthens the customers' CSR perceptionâCâC identification relationship and the indirect relationship between CSR perception and CSR participation intention through CâC identification. We conducted a survey of 567 South Korean bank customers and performed structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. CâC identification partially mediated the relationship between customers' CSR perception and CSR participation intention. The positive association between customers' CSR perception and CâC identification was more pronounced when CSR credibility was higher than when it was lower. CSR credibility further moderated the indirect effect of customers' CSR perception and CSR participation intention through C-C identification. This study deepens CSR research by showing how a cognitive CSR perception leads to a behavioral CSR participation based on a research model.

Customers prefer transparent information that allows them to trust companies and then show interest in their services or products. Corporate social responsibility is one of the critical factors influencing the image. Because the concept of CSR significantly affects the perception of the company among customers and society. Strengthening the image is one of the fundamental goals of marketing. The CSR concept is thus one of the possible aspects of strengthening the image and thus having the edge over the competition. This chapter examines the relationships between CSR communication, brand reputation, and customer shopping intentions.

Customers prefer transparent information that allows them to trust companies and then show interest in their services or products. Corporate social responsibility is one of the critical factors influencing the image. Because the concept of CSR significantly affects the perception of the company among customers and society. Strengthening the image is one of the fundamental goals of marketing. The CSR concept is thus one of the possible aspects of strengthening the image and thus having the edge over the competition. This chapter examines the relationships between CSR communication, brand reputation, and customer shopping intentions.

However, empirical research about the robustness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and brand loyalty (BL) yields inconsistent findings. Therefore, we aggregated the results of 43 citations consisting of 28495 observations by means of meta-analysis to examine the robustness of the CSR-BL relationship. The findings of our research revealed that the overall effect size of the CSR and brand loyalty relationship is positive and yields a medium effect size. Furthermore, such a relationship was moderated by several contextual factors. We conclude with a theoretical contribution, managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future studies.

However, empirical research about the robustness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and brand loyalty (BL) yields inconsistent findings. Therefore, we aggregated the results of 43 citations consisting of 28495 observations by means of meta-analysis to examine the robustness of the CSR-BL relationship. The findings of our research revealed that the overall effect size of the CSR and brand loyalty relationship is positive and yields a medium effect size. Furthermore, such a relationship was moderated by several contextual factors. We conclude with a theoretical contribution, managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future studies.

How does CSR influence the consumer behaviour towards profit making for the enterprise? This issue has been an important research topic in the enterprise and management areas. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying how CSR can affect the consumer behavioural intention (CBI) have rarely been addressed in the literature. This study investigates the relationship between CSR and CBI, emphasising on using corporate image and customer satisfaction as the mediate factors. Focusing on the bicycle industry, a total number of 491 valid questionnaires from the consumers are retrieved and are then analyzed using the structural equation modelling. Our analyses show that CSR has a positive effect on corporate image, customer satisfaction, and price premium. In addition, CSR can affect the customer behavioural intention (purchase intention and price premium) through enhancing corporate image and customer satisfaction. Our results clarify the relationship between CSR and CBI, and can offer a sound academic support for future related research and practical applications.

How does CSR influence the consumer behaviour towards profit making for the enterprise? This issue has been an important research topic in the enterprise and management areas. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying how CSR can affect the consumer behavioural intention (CBI) have rarely been addressed in the literature. This study investigates the relationship between CSR and CBI, emphasising on using corporate image and customer satisfaction as the mediate factors. Focusing on the bicycle industry, a total number of 491 valid questionnaires from the consumers are retrieved and are then analyzed using the structural equation modelling. Our analyses show that CSR has a positive effect on corporate image, customer satisfaction, and price premium. In addition, CSR can affect the customer behavioural intention (purchase intention and price premium) through enhancing corporate image and customer satisfaction. Our results clarify the relationship between CSR and CBI, and can offer a sound academic support for future related research and practical applications.

This paper aims to model the impact of CSR on financial and social performance of firms as well as consumer reactions. The required data are gathered using random sampling and a questionnaire developed by the authors, enjoying 97% reliability. The statistical population includes the managers and top customers of a select group of food companies in the City of Khuzestan (Iran). Five hundred forty individuals are selected as the sample. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, e.g., structural equations are carried out using SPSS and AMOS software packages. The results indicate that all hypotheses are supported with 95% confidence. Therefore, CSR affects financial performance both directly and by mediation through social responsibility and consumer reactions.

This paper aims to model the impact of CSR on financial and social performance of firms as well as consumer reactions. The required data are gathered using random sampling and a questionnaire developed by the authors, enjoying 97% reliability. The statistical population includes the managers and top customers of a select group of food companies in the City of Khuzestan (Iran). Five hundred forty individuals are selected as the sample. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, e.g., structural equations are carried out using SPSS and AMOS software packages. The results indicate that all hypotheses are supported with 95% confidence. Therefore, CSR affects financial performance both directly and by mediation through social responsibility and consumer reactions. Copyright Â© 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",0.30600827039630074

Design/methodology/approach â A quantitative meta-analysis of 37 articles (n = 34,942) was conducted to determine the effect sizes of the relationship between CSR and BI of the customer. Furthermore, two kinds of contextual factors (environmental context and industry type) have been investigated as potential moderators between CSR and BI. Findings â Meta-analysis suggests that the positive relationship between CSR and BI is well-established and has a large effect size (r = 0.42). Individually, the repurchase/revisit intention was the most affected by CSR (r = 47) followed by loyalty intention (r = 0.41) where both word of mouth and willingness-to-pay intentions were less affected by CSR (r = 0.38, r = 0.37, respectively). Moreover, the result of meta-regression shows that both environmental context and industry type do not moderate the relationship between CSR and BI. Originality/value â The originality of this paper comes from presenting a summary of the direction of research on primary relationship between CSR and BI, as no prior meta-analysis on the primary relationship has been conducted till date (to the best of the authorsâ knowledge).

Design/methodology/approach â A quantitative meta-analysis of 37 articles (n = 34,942) was conducted to determine the effect sizes of the relationship between CSR and BI of the customer. Furthermore, two kinds of contextual factors (environmental context and industry type) have been investigated as potential moderators between CSR and BI. Findings â Meta-analysis suggests that the positive relationship between CSR and BI is well-established and has a large effect size (r = 0.42). Individually, the repurchase/revisit intention was the most affected by CSR (r = 47) followed by loyalty intention (r = 0.41) where both word of mouth and willingness-to-pay intentions were less affected by CSR (r = 0.38, r = 0.37, respectively). Moreover, the result of meta-regression shows that both environmental context and industry type do not moderate the relationship between CSR and BI. Originality/value â The originality of this paper comes from presenting a summary of the direction of research on primary relationship between CSR and BI, as no prior meta-analysis on the primary relationship has been conducted till date (to the best of the authorsâ knowledge).

There is a need for an in-depth study into the relationship between CSR and WTP, and to identify the mediators and the moderators affecting this relationship. To investigate this, we conducted a systematic literature review based on a preliminary search result of 116 unique articles indexed on this topic in four bibliographic databasesâScopus, Google Scholar, Dimensions and Web of Scienceâpublished over the previous seven decades. The findings confirm the overall positive effect of CSR on WTP. This study also reveals the indirect effect between CSR and WTP, mediated by variables like Brand Trust, Brand Loyalty, Brand Love, Customer Satisfaction, Brand Attitude, Purchase Intention and Brand Equity. The relationship is impacted by moderators, including demographics, cause-based aspects, company characteristics, personal aspects and types of products. The theory explaining the evidence of each of these aspects provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between CSR and WTP, and the intervening variables. Based on these, a conceptual framework of this relationship involving all the variables is developed. The Theory, Context and Method (TCM) framework is employed to identify gaps and systematically make recommendations for future research. The findings of this study will aid marketers in developing pricing strategies based on a thorough understanding of consumer behaviour in terms of CSR perceptions. Scholars can use this study's conceptual framework to examine previously unexplored relationships. As the literature on CSR and its influence on consumers' purchase behaviour grows, this comprehensive systematic literature review on the effects of CSR on WTP fills an important gap.

There is a need for an in-depth study into the relationship between CSR and WTP, and to identify the mediators and the moderators affecting this relationship. To investigate this, we conducted a systematic literature review based on a preliminary search result of 116 unique articles indexed on this topic in four bibliographic databasesâScopus, Google Scholar, Dimensions and Web of Scienceâpublished over the previous seven decades. The findings confirm the overall positive effect of CSR on WTP. This study also reveals the indirect effect between CSR and WTP, mediated by variables like Brand Trust, Brand Loyalty, Brand Love, Customer Satisfaction, Brand Attitude, Purchase Intention and Brand Equity. The relationship is impacted by moderators, including demographics, cause-based aspects, company characteristics, personal aspects and types of products. The theory explaining the evidence of each of these aspects provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between CSR and WTP, and the intervening variables. Based on these, a conceptual framework of this relationship involving all the variables is developed. The Theory, Context and Method (TCM) framework is employed to identify gaps and systematically make recommendations for future research. The findings of this study will aid marketers in developing pricing strategies based on a thorough understanding of consumer behaviour in terms of CSR perceptions. Scholars can use this study's conceptual framework to examine previously unexplored relationships. As the literature on CSR and its influence on consumers' purchase behaviour grows, this comprehensive systematic literature review on the effects of CSR on WTP fills an important gap.

Further, the impact of awareness as a moderating variable between CSR and purchase intention has been examined. The conclusion drawn from this study have important implications for Indian banks as they suggest that building a socially responsible image might have a favorable effect on consumer purchase intention. Findings suggest that corporate ability has a strong effect on customer purchase intention while CSR activities were found to exert influence on customer purchase intention in cases where the customer was aware of such activities being conducted. This paper contributes to existing CSR literature by offering a deeper understanding into CSR dynamics and its effect on consumer purchase intention. Further, the study tests the level of consumer awareness of CSR activities in a real market situation (not artificial or simulated) which has not been done in previous studies.

Further, the impact of awareness as a moderating variable between CSR and purchase intention has been examined. The conclusion drawn from this study have important implications for Indian banks as they suggest that building a socially responsible image might have a favorable effect on consumer purchase intention. Findings suggest that corporate ability has a strong effect on customer purchase intention while CSR activities were found to exert influence on customer purchase intention in cases where the customer was aware of such activities being conducted. This paper contributes to existing CSR literature by offering a deeper understanding into CSR dynamics and its effect on consumer purchase intention.

Yet, this sector has witnessed some of the greatest cases of corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR). The purpose of this study is to investigate the mediating role of corporate reputation on the relationships between CSR/CSiR and customer trust, retailer equity, and share of wallet. As customers may hold a mixed set of positive and negative beliefs about retailersâ CSR and CSiR, this paper also explores how customersâ CSR and CSiR perceptions interact to impact corporate reputation. Based on a representative sample of 840 French customers surveyed with respect to a grocery retailer, our results show that customersâ CSR perceptions positively influence corporate reputation, but that this relationship is negatively moderated by their CSiR perceptions. Our study also highlights the mediating role of corporate reputation between CSR perceptions and customer trust, retailer equity, and share of wallet.

Yet, this sector has witnessed some of the greatest cases of corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR). The purpose of this study is to investigate the mediating role of corporate reputation on the relationships between CSR/CSiR and customer trust, retailer equity, and share of wallet. As customers may hold a mixed set of positive and negative beliefs about retailersâ CSR and CSiR, this paper also explores how customersâ CSR and CSiR perceptions interact to impact corporate reputation. Based on a representative sample of 840 French customers surveyed with respect to a grocery retailer, our results show that customersâ CSR perceptions positively influence corporate reputation, but that this relationship is negatively moderated by their CSiR perceptions. Our study also highlights the mediating role of corporate reputation between CSR perceptions and customer trust, retailer equity, and share of wallet. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0.31880690809789325

However, this effect is moderated by the consumer-brand social distance. In two experiments, we show that consumers close to the brand become more prosocial in situations unrelated to the cause supported by the company when they are exposed to the brand's prosocial communication, compared to those who are distant from the brand. This paper contributes to furthering CSR theory by showing the positive effects of brand CSR initiatives on secondary social outcomes, such as consumers' volunteering and donating money to a social cause not closely related to the one promoted by the company. Besides, this paper also contributes theoretically by showing the moderation role played by consumer-brand social distance. Important implications for the role of CSR are useful for companies and society in general, since the paper demonstrates that brand's prosocial behavior can influence consumers' prosocial behavior beyond the brand context only.

However, this effect is moderated by the consumer-brand social distance. In two experiments, we show that consumers close to the brand become more prosocial in situations unrelated to the cause supported by the company when they are exposed to the brand's prosocial communication, compared to those who are distant from the brand. This paper contributes to furthering CSR theory by showing the positive effects of brand CSR initiatives on secondary social outcomes, such as consumers' volunteering and donating money to a social cause not closely related to the one promoted by the company. Besides, this paper also contributes theoretically by showing the moderation role played by consumer-brand social distance. Important implications for the role of CSR are useful for companies and society in general, since the paper demonstrates that brand's prosocial behavior can influence consumers' prosocial behavior beyond the brand context only.

Additionally, the study seeks to determine the impact of these factors on consumer behavior. This research endeavor included the gathering of data from Taiwan and Indonesia, with the aim of investigating the influence of ESG practices and CSR initiatives on customer attitudes and purchase intentions. The study used STATISTA 10 and LISREL to examine the impact of environmental, social, and governance practices on CSR activities. The findings indicated that the integration of environmental practices had a positive effect on CSR initiatives, but the influence of social and governance practices exhibited variability. The research emphasizes the importance of proficiently communicating environmental policies and proposes that organizations should prioritize environmental actions in order to bolster their brand and gain customer confidence. The results also underscore the need for consumer education about the ESG framework. The research closes by emphasizing the management implications, recommending that organizations should embrace a comprehensive strategy towards ESG and CSR policies in order to enhance company performance and ensure long-term sustainability.

Additionally, the study seeks to determine the impact of these factors on consumer behavior. This research endeavor included the gathering of data from Taiwan and Indonesia, with the aim of investigating the influence of ESG practices and CSR initiatives on customer attitudes and purchase intentions. The study used STATISTA 10 and LISREL to examine the impact of environmental, social, and governance practices on CSR activities. The findings indicated that the integration of environmental practices had a positive effect on CSR initiatives, but the influence of social and governance practices exhibited variability. The research emphasizes the importance of proficiently communicating environmental policies and proposes that organizations should prioritize environmental actions in order to bolster their brand and gain customer confidence. The results also underscore the need for consumer education about the ESG framework. The research closes by emphasizing the management implications, recommending that organizations should embrace a comprehensive strategy towards ESG and CSR policies in order to enhance company performance and ensure long-term sustainability.

We propose that this influence depends on the firm's motivation for CSR, and is moderated by the consumer-brand social distance. Two experiments demonstrate that consumers close to a brand become less pro-social when the firm's motivation is perceived as self-serving (vs. public-serving), whereas consumers distant from the brand are equally influenced by the CSR action regardless of the motivation behind it. A mediation analysis supported the hypothesis that this effect occurs because of consumer skepticism about the CSR action. When the firm's motivation is self-serving (vs. public-serving), consumers close to the brand become more skeptical, which decreases their intention to support a social cause. Our results contribute theoretically by showing that the positive and negative effects of CSR practices on consumersâ pro-social behavior are moderated by consumer-brand social distance. We also show the mediating role played by consumer skepticism. Moreover, we demonstrate that CSR influences consumer behavior beyond the consumer-brand dyadic relationship.

There is a need to understand customersâ perception of CSR activities for future corporate profitability. Thus, this study investigates the effect of multidimensional CSR activities on customersâ corporate image, customer citizenship behavior (CCB), and long-term relationship orientation (LRO). The results indicate that CSR (economic, ethical, legal, and philanthropic) had a positive effect on corporate image and on CCB (making recommendation, helping other consumers, and providing feedback). It also appears that CCB had a positive effect on LRO with firms. This study provides empirical implications for companies by verifying the effect of CSR activities as a focal factor in building long-term relationships as an organizational goal in the foodservice industry.

There is a need to understand customersâ perception of CSR activities for future corporate profitability. Thus, this study investigates the effect of multidimensional CSR activities on customersâ corporate image, customer citizenship behavior (CCB), and long-term relationship orientation (LRO). The results indicate that CSR (economic, ethical, legal, and philanthropic) had a positive effect on corporate image and on CCB (making recommendation, helping other consumers, and providing feedback). It also appears that CCB had a positive effect on LRO with firms. This study provides empirical implications for companies by verifying the effect of CSR activities as a focal factor in building long-term relationships as an organizational goal in the foodservice industry.

We also examine the moderating role of firms' brand equity and corporate reputation in the relationship between perceived CSR and affective commitment. The data were collected from two online surveys and analyzed using Hayes' PROCESS macro. The results indicate a partial mediating effect of affective commitment and a significant moderating effect of brand equity. However, the moderating effect of corporate reputation is not significant.

We also examine the moderating role of firms' brand equity and corporate reputation in the relationship between perceived CSR and affective commitment. The data were collected from two online surveys and analyzed using Hayes' PROCESS macro. The results indicate a partial mediating effect of affective commitment and a significant moderating effect of brand equity. However, the moderating effect of corporate reputation is not significant.

This is because many factors indirectly influence this relation. Therefore, this study considers sustainable competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction as three probable mediators in the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The findings from 205 Iranian manufacturing and consumer product firms reveal that the link between CSR and firm performance is a fully mediated relationship. The positive effect of CSR on firm performance is due to the positive effect CSR has on competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction. The final findings show that only reputation and competitive advantage mediate the relationship between CSR and firm performance. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for CSR in indirectly promoting firm performance through enhancing reputation and competitive advantage while improving the level of customer satisfaction.

The mediating role of competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction Direct relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm performance has been examined by many scholars, but this direct test seems to be spurious and imprecise. This is because many factors indirectly influence this relation. Therefore, this study considers sustainable competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction as three probable mediators in the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The findings from 205 Iranian manufacturing and consumer product firms reveal that the link between CSR and firm performance is a fully mediated relationship. The positive effect of CSR on firm performance is due to the positive effect CSR has on competitive advantage, reputation, and customer satisfaction. The final findings show that only reputation and competitive advantage mediate the relationship between CSR and firm performance. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for CSR in indirectly promoting firm performance through enhancing reputation and competitive advantage while improving the level of customer satisfaction.

The aim is to provide insight into the effect of perceived CSR on purchase intention (short-term effect) and corporate reputation (long-term effect), whilst considering the role of brand image, satisfaction (affective and cognitive) and brand loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprised 429 consumers selected using non-probabilistic sampling with age and gender quotas. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the measurement model. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the research hypotheses. Findings: All direct and mediated influences in the model were significant, except for the effects of perceived CSR on affective satisfaction. Thus, the proposed causal chain is valuable to understand how perceptions of CSR influence purchase intention and perceived reputation. Research limitations/implications: Perception is considered a dual phenomenon (cognitive and affective). It would be advisable to consider both dimensions in the future. The same is true of affective satisfaction. Originality/value: Direct and mediated relationships that have previously been studied separately are considered together in a single model. This approach provides a better understanding of how perceived CSR influences purchase intention and reputation. Â© 2019, Enrique Bianchi, Juan Manuel Bruno and Francisco J.

perceived CSR on corporate reputation and purchase intention Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of consumersâ perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR). The aim is to provide insight into the effect of perceived CSR on purchase intention (short-term effect) and corporate reputation (long-term effect), whilst considering the role of brand image, satisfaction (affective and cognitive) and brand loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprised 429 consumers selected using non-probabilistic sampling with age and gender quotas. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the measurement model. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the research hypotheses. Findings: All direct and mediated influences in the model were significant, except for the effects of perceived CSR on affective satisfaction. Thus, the proposed causal chain is valuable to understand how perceptions of CSR influence purchase intention and perceived reputation. Research limitations/implications: Perception is considered a dual phenomenon (cognitive and affective). It would be advisable to consider both dimensions in the future. The same is true of affective satisfaction. Originality/value: Direct and mediated relationships that have previously been studied separately are considered together in a single model. This approach provides a better understanding of how perceived CSR influences purchase intention and reputation. Â© 2019, Enrique Bianchi, Juan Manuel Bruno and Francisco J.

This conceptualization fails to consider the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) polices and practices in forming store image. Results from a study of 460 consumers indicate CSR influences consumer store image. CSR is particularly effective at influencing store image when the retailer experiences a positive performance perception among its customers. Consumers shopping at such stores are more receptive to CSR programs, and experience significant increases in their level of satisfaction and loyalty to the store through the addition of these programs.

This conceptualization fails to consider the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) polices and practices in forming store image. Results from a study of 460 consumers indicate CSR influences consumer store image. CSR is particularly effective at influencing store image when the retailer experiences a positive performance perception among its customers. Consumers shopping at such stores are more receptive to CSR programs, and experience significant increases in their level of satisfaction and loyalty to the store through the addition of these programs.

A scientific mapping was performed using VosViewer software through a semi-systematic literature review, which utilized co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling. Research opportunities were identified based on a qualitative analysis of the future research sections of the articles. The results demonstrate a vast scientific production that associates marketing with CSR. The analysis of the studies shows a movement away from topics such as financial performance to a focus on topics such as consumer behavior and relationships with stakeholders. Opportunities for theoretical, methodological, and empirical studies are presented, facilitating the development of new research and the filling of gaps identified by researchers.

A scientific mapping was performed using VosViewer software through a semi-systematic literature review, which utilized co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling. Research opportunities were identified based on a qualitative analysis of the future research sections of the articles. The results demonstrate a vast scientific production that associates marketing with CSR. The analysis of the studies shows a movement away from topics such as financial performance to a focus on topics such as consumer behavior and relationships with stakeholders. Opportunities for theoretical, methodological, and empirical studies are presented, facilitating the development of new research and the filling of gaps identified by researchers.

In addition, we examine how CSR contributes to the growth of customer engagement. Customers of Indian banks made up the studyâs target population, and 363 responses were collected as part of the sample. According to the findings, customer perception of CSR is favorably correlated with customer engagement and CCB. Moreover, customer engagement serves as a mediating factor in the link between consumer perception of CSR and CCB. Our findings demonstrate that CSR influences consumer engagement directly, and that customer engagement partially mediates the relationship between CSR and CCB. The results also provide evidence in favor of CSR and customer engagement as CCB outcomes.

In addition, we examine how CSR contributes to the growth of customer engagement. Customers of Indian banks made up the studyâs target population, and 363 responses were collected as part of the sample. According to the findings, customer perception of CSR is favorably correlated with customer engagement and CCB. Moreover, customer engagement serves as a mediating factor in the link between consumer perception of CSR and CCB. Our findings demonstrate that CSR influences consumer engagement directly, and that customer engagement partially mediates the relationship between CSR and CCB. The results also provide evidence in favor of CSR and customer engagement as CCB outcomes. Â© 2023 by the authors.",0.33701611797801523

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, data was collected from banking consumers in India. The final sample included 505 responses. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings suggest that consumer perceptions of CSR are positively related to consumer identification with the company and CCB. Also, the relationship between consumer perception of CSR and CCB is mediated through consumerâcompany identification. This suggests that CSR activities are positively related with the consumer identification with their company, which encourages CCB. Originality/value: This study contributes empirically and theoretically to expand the limited knowledge about the cognitive link between CSR and consumer behaviour. This study provides new insights about the proposed relationships related to the effects of consumer perception of CSR on CCB.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, data was collected from banking consumers in India. The final sample included 505 responses. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings suggest that consumer perceptions of CSR are positively related to consumer identification with the company and CCB. Also, the relationship between consumer perception of CSR and CCB is mediated through consumerâcompany identification. This suggests that CSR activities are positively related with the consumer identification with their company, which encourages CCB. Originality/value: This study contributes empirically and theoretically to expand the limited knowledge about the cognitive link between CSR and consumer behaviour. This study provides new insights about the proposed relationships related to the effects of consumer perception of CSR on CCB. Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0.33862489292398124

For example: some CSR information could be showed in the âCOMMODITY DETAILSâ. Could this kind of information affect consumer behavior? By recognizing three types of embedded CSRC information, according to the consumer behavior experiments, this paper will show CSRâs influences on the consumer behavior such as evaluation of the company, purchasing intention, and purchasing intention. By the comparison of the results after three typesâ CSR communication, we found that CSR information could significantly affect consumer behavior and the consumer response will differ from different types of CSR information embedded.

By recognizing three types of embedded CSRC information, according to the consumer behavior experiments, this paper will show CSRâs influences on the consumer behavior such as evaluation of the company, purchasing intention, and purchasing intention. By the comparison of the results after three typesâ CSR communication, we found that CSR information could significantly affect consumer behavior and the consumer response will differ from different types of CSR information embedded.

Results show that perceived CSR and its dimensions are positively related to employeesâ positive attitudes and behaviours, and negatively related to their negative attitudes and behaviours. The results also partially support the moderating effects of the samplesâ demographic characteristics in terms of ageÂ and gender, and national culture. This study supplements existing theoretical review articles, and further confirms the psychological effects of perceived CSR. In addition, the results further confirm the rationality of CSR practices and provide suggestions for enterprises to better use CSR strategies to motivate their employees.

employeesâ perceived CSR and its dimensions and work outcomes, and explores the moderating effects of the samplesâ demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age), and national culture, based on a meta-analysis of 65 studies from 67 samples. Results show that perceived CSR and its dimensions are positively related to employeesâ positive attitudes and behaviours, and negatively related to their negative attitudes and behaviours. The results also partially support the moderating effects of the samplesâ demographic characteristics in terms of ageÂ and gender, and national culture. This study supplements existing theoretical review articles, and further confirms the psychological effects of perceived CSR. In addition, the results further confirm the rationality of CSR practices and provide suggestions for enterprises to better use CSR strategies to motivate their employees.

Leopoldo, Brazil","Purpose: This study aims to consolidate finds about corporate social responsibility (CSR) by conducting a meta-analysis. CSR is a topic present in both academic and practitioner discussions. Research has been conducted in different countries and contexts, using diverse methodological approaches. Consequently, there are different views about CSR and conflicting results. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducted a meta-analysis to analyse the constructs that are antecedents and consequences of CSR. This paper has also tested the moderating effects of theoretical, methodological and economic variables. The data analysis involved 66 studies, which generated 385 observations and an accumulated sample of 19,817 respondents. Findings: The findings indicate that environmental concerns, market orientation and stakeholder pressure are the most relevant CSR antecedents. On the other hand, CSR has the strongest effects on organisational commitment, non-financial performance and customer purchasing intention. Also, firm size and cultural orientation were partially significant moderators on the relationships between organisational commitment, CSR and financial performance. Originality/value: The meta-analytical approach allows for more accurate effect size estimations for each relationship analysed, as the meta-analytic method jointly evaluates the results produced by a great variety of studies performed in different contexts, making it possible to draw more accurate conclusions.

CSR is a topic present in both academic and practitioner discussions. Research has been conducted in different countries and contexts, using diverse methodological approaches. Consequently, there are different views about CSR and conflicting results. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducted a meta-analysis to analyse the constructs that are antecedents and consequences of CSR. This paper has also tested the moderating effects of theoretical, methodological and economic variables. The data analysis involved 66 studies, which generated 385 observations and an accumulated sample of 19,817 respondents. Findings: The findings indicate that environmental concerns, market orientation and stakeholder pressure are the most relevant CSR antecedents. On the other hand, CSR has the strongest effects on organisational commitment, non-financial performance and customer purchasing intention. Also, firm size and cultural orientation were partially significant moderators on the relationships between organisational commitment, CSR and financial performance. Originality/value: The meta-analytical approach allows for more accurate effect size estimations for each relationship analysed, as the meta-analytic method jointly evaluates the results produced by a great variety of studies performed in different contexts, making it possible to draw more accurate conclusions.

This paper analyzes the attitudes and behaviors of university students in Business Management, as consumers and as potential executives, toward CSR practices. For this purpose, 1020 students from Brazil and Spain were interviewed. The results of the survey highlight some significant differences with regard to the importance that young consumers attach to the various CSR activities in their own purchasing decisions, depending on the economic and social context analyzed.

This paper analyzes the attitudes and behaviors of university students in Business Management, as consumers and as potential executives, toward CSR practices. For this purpose, 1020 students from Brazil and Spain were interviewed. The results of the survey highlight some significant differences with regard to the importance that young consumers attach to the various CSR activities in their own purchasing decisions, depending on the economic and social context analyzed.

However, research on the topic is fragmented across disparate disciplines, and a comprehensive framework to connect CSR supply and demand is missing. As a result, firms often supply CSR that does not attract demand, as signified by pessimism about ethical consumerism in recent years and the inconclusive link between corporate financial and social performance. In this study, we propose a framework of strategic CSR management to define how a companyâs supply of CSR could meet consumer demand for ethical products by aligning managerial and consumer perspectives. We then investigate empirically whether such a strategic approach, which integrates potential demand in CSR management, would influence consumer choice of products with CSR components. Our hybrid choice modeling allows the inclusion of psychological biases caused by social desirability and cynicism to increase result validity. The findings support the explanatory power of the framework and reveal that consumers prefer some CSR elements while others adversely affect choices. This study advances the understanding of strategic CSR management and its impact on consumer choice and helps managers include the right mix of CSR characteristics in their products to satisfy ethical consumers.

However, research on the topic is fragmented across disparate disciplines, and a comprehensive framework to connect CSR supply and demand is missing. As a result, firms often supply CSR that does not attract demand, as signified by pessimism about ethical consumerism in recent years and the inconclusive link between corporate financial and social performance. In this study, we propose a framework of strategic CSR management to define how a companyâs supply of CSR could meet consumer demand for ethical products by aligning managerial and consumer perspectives. We then investigate empirically whether such a strategic approach, which integrates potential demand in CSR management, would influence consumer choice of products with CSR components. Our hybrid choice modeling allows the inclusion of psychological biases caused by social desirability and cynicism to increase result validity. The findings support the explanatory power of the framework and reveal that consumers prefer some CSR elements while others adversely affect choices. This study advances the understanding of strategic CSR management and its impact on consumer choice and helps managers include the right mix of CSR characteristics in their products to satisfy ethical consumers.

CSR is considered a strategic policy that offers environmental and social competitive advantages. Organizations consider that CSR-based goodwill provides a tactical competitive edge and sustainable growth. The goal of this paper is to show how CSR programs affect consumersâ purchasing intention in the context of Pakistan. In addition, the effect of customer awareness has been studied as a moderator between CSR and purchasing intention. To this end, the study has conducted a survey and gathered Pakistani customersâ responses, and structural equation modeling has been used to evaluate the results.

CSR is considered a strategic policy that offers environmental and social competitive advantages. Organizations consider that CSR-based goodwill provides a tactical competitive edge and sustainable growth. The goal of this paper is to show how CSR programs affect consumersâ purchasing intention in the context of Pakistan. In addition, the effect of customer awareness has been studied as a moderator between CSR and purchasing intention. To this end, the study has conducted a survey and gathered Pakistani customersâ responses, and structural equation modeling has been used to evaluate the results. The study concludes that CSR activities favorably affect customer purchasing intentions directly as well as indirectly through improving brand image and trust, and customer awareness of CSR activities plays a moderating role. The implications and future research directions are discussed. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0.34365657138371264

This study analyzed the impact of CSR on consumers' purchase intentions. The significance of this study arises from the fact that all progressive companies are increasing their expenditure on CSR activities. In this study, purchase intention was considered as a dependent variable, while trust, ethical, and legal CSR activities were the independent variables. Data for the study was collected from 210 randomly chosen respondents from amongst consumers of Delhi and National Capital Region of India. The data, analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling, found that trust, ethics, and legal CSR activities directly impacted consumer purchase intentions. These results indicate that legal factors do not significantly influence the corporate decision on spending on CSR activities. On the other hand, ethical factors and trust factors significantly influence the corporate decision on expenditure on CSR activities. The findings highlight companies' requirements to be conscious of their social image. Probable limitations of the study could include sample size and the number of variables chosen.

An examination using structural equation modeling Organizations place great value on corporate social responsibility (CSR), as it has been found to influence customer attitudes and intentions. This study analyzed the impact of CSR on consumers' purchase intentions. The significance of this study arises from the fact that all progressive companies are increasing their expenditure on CSR activities. In this study, purchase intention was considered as a dependent variable, while trust, ethical, and legal CSR activities were the independent variables. Data for the study was collected from 210 randomly chosen respondents from amongst consumers of Delhi and National Capital Region of India. The data, analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling, found that trust, ethics, and legal CSR activities directly impacted consumer purchase intentions. These results indicate that legal factors do not significantly influence the corporate decision on spending on CSR activities. On the other hand, ethical factors and trust factors significantly influence the corporate decision on expenditure on CSR activities. The findings highlight companies' requirements to be conscious of their social image. Probable limitations of the study could include sample size and the number of variables chosen.
